# bootcamp-semantic-html

First assignment Week 1

# Explanation of Work

Changed all \<div> tags to be \<section>  
Went through and cleaned up CSS as some classes had repeated styles. These were just commented out.  
Renamed classes to match the changed tags in the HTML file.  
Edited the ignore file to ignore my copies of the original code.

## Submission 2 changes

Went through and changed "section" tags with ones that made more sense like header, footer, main, and article as given in the feedback suggestion. These are tags do the same job as div or section but help with the logical layout and orginization of the webpage which will help software that reads the HTML more so than it will help a human viewing the page. To make sure everything remained the same, I visually compared between the deployed site and the one I hosted locally.
