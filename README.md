# bootcamp-semantic-html
First assignment Week 1

# Explanation of Work
Changed all \<div> tags to be \<section>  
Went through and cleaned up CSS as some classes had repeated styles. These were just commented out.  
Renamed classes to match the changed tags in the HTML file.  
Edited the ignore file to ignore my copies of the original code.
